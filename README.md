Aman  — Community Watch & Lost & Found
Aman is a MERN stack web application designed to help residents stay informed about safety concerns in their neighborhood and support one another in returning lost items.
The platform allows users to submit different types of reports, track their status, browse community-approved posts, and interact through comments.
Admins verify reports to ensure accuracy, credibility, and community trust.
